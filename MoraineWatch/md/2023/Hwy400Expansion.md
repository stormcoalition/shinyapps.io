# Highway 400 Expansion - King Rd to Lloydtown Aurora from 6 lanes to 10 lanes 

**Location:** on Oak Ridges Moraine, north of 15th sideroad

**Approval:** Work contemplated in a preliminary design from 2002, proceeding based on MTO-initiated 2021 Detailed Design Report.

**Concerns:** Unclear when the government made the decision to proceed with this work. Connections to Highway 413? Work may have started ahead of permits â€“ well is drilled, and construction was observed to start prior to the species benefit permit being approved. Water extracted discharged?
