# Temporary Use Zoning By-Law coming before the City of Vaughan.

**Location:** on Oak Ridges Moraine, 141 Maloy St (Keele & King Vaughan Rd). Site is on the ORM (Natural Linkage and abuts Natural Core) and requested temporary parking lot for storage of vehicles. 

**Concerns:** Precedent setting decision that would lead to municipalities approving temporary zoning use by-laws, that are not permitted on the ORMCA and lead to irreversible changes to natural heritage features intended to be protected by ORM land use designations. [From Council Meeting Minutes of September 28, 2022](https://pub-vaughan.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=120756):

- Proposed temporary outside storage of 817 motor vehicles, including the temporary preparation and inspection of new motor vehicles as an accessory use.
- The Planning Act, requires that all planning decisions conform to Provincial Policies, including the policies of the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan. Even if local Official Plan permit the approval of temporary use by-laws it does not mean that it gives authority to municipalities to give temporary-uses that are not in conformity with provincial legislation.
- Temporary uses may cause permanent irreversible damage to natural heritage features on and off-site that are protected as Natural Linkage and Natural Core. This would undermine the purpose and intent of the ORMCA to restore the ecological integrity and protect hydrological features and functions.

**Additional Notes:**

- [Tuesday, April 09, 2024 CofW Meeting](https://pub-vaughan.escribemeetings.com/Meeting.aspx?Id=50d16b50-c049-4084-8e58-2e4ac13b68b7&Agenda=Agenda&lang=English), Regional Councillor Jackson brought forward a motion (around the 26th minute mark on the video). **_There is no written record_**. Motion is seeking staff to bring forward a report about conformity/authority to approve a temporary use on the ORM. 
- This has potential to be a precedent setting decision, there are historical non-compliance issues all over this area some with open and ongoing legal action. If this temporary zoning by-law proceeds it will likely absolve ongoing charges/investigations not just for this site but many others.
