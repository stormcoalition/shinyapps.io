Stouville Council endorsed a MZO (Nov, 2024) requesting the Minister, MMAH approve a severance of the subject property to develop the lands for a new single detached dwelling. The proposed lot creation and new residential development is not permitted by the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan policies and the Provincial Policy Statement. The lands are located in the Natural Linkage land use designation. Policies on new lot creation in the Natural Core and Natural Linkage Areas are very restrictive, this would be a precedent setting decision that would open the door and justify future requests or at worse a watering down of these restrictions.
